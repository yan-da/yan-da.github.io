I am currently a 4th-year PhD candicate in the CSE Department, HKUST, advised by Dr. [Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/index.html). Before that, I received B.Eng. degree from HUST in 2016.

My research interests are machine learning/dense linear algebra operations optimization on GPUs and compiler-aided GPU performance optimization.
